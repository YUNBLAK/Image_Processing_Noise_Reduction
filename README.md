### Image Processing for Noise Reduction

When analyzing our image, the noise present in the image can cause problems in finding the desired image part or characteristics. Therefore, we implemented a method to eliminate the noise of images before finding the desired characteristics in the images.

In this original image, when we create an algorithm to find a black spot, we detect the sunspots and the noise simultaneously due to the noise. To prevent such problems in advance, we de-noise the images, making them easier to detect sunspots.
